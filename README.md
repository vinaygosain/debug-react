debug-react is a small utility to debug and understand react codebase and its flow.


First of all thanks to the `React` repo and all its contributors developing and maintaining it.

## Motivation

Very less or no options available to debug react repo in real time or on chrome devtools. Couldn't find a way of putting up a debug point or making a change and seeing it on the fly while debugging react repo. So, this repo is just an attempt to setup a small subrepo inside react to help debug and understand it better. You can now use es6 sourcemaps and webpack dev server to bundle react directly in a small app residing inside `app` folder.

## Installation

```
cd app
yarn start
```

## Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to help people debug react faster and easier on chrome or any other devtools.
